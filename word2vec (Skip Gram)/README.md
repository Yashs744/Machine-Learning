# word2vec
## Skip Gram Model using Tensorflow.

Libraries:
``` tensorflow, numpy, sklearn and matplotlib```

Skip-Gram is a <b>word2vec</b> model in which 2k distinct auxiliary task are created, each pairing the focus word with a different context word.
In baisc terminology, it's a model that tries to predict the context word giving a center (or focus).

<b>Files</b><br />
  1. Dataset used to train the model is ```Alice in Wonderland``` which is available in 11-0.txt file.
  2. final_embedding_matrix file stores the final matrix after training the model.
  3. Skip-Gram Model using Tensorflow.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook with Source Code.
